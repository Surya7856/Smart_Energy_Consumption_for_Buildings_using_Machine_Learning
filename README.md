# 🏢 Energy Consumption Prediction in Buildings 🌍

This project leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning to predict and analyze energy consumption in buildings, providing actionable insights for optimizing energy usage. It uses techniques like XGBoost for building a highly accurate predictive model.

## 🛠️ Features:

- Accurate prediction of energy consumption using machine learning.
- Automated data preprocessing and feature engineering for high-quality inputs.
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
- Scalable solution adaptable to various building types and energy use scenarios.

## 🧰 Technologies Used:

- **Python** for development.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Feature Engineering** to extract meaningful patterns from raw data.
- **XGBoost** for building a robust and efficient predictive model.
- **Matplotlib** or **Seaborn** for data visualization and analysis.

## 🚀 How It Works:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical energy usage data, weather conditions, and operational parameters.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling, and normalizing features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features such as time of day, occupancy, or equipment usage patterns.
4. **Model Selection**: Use techniques like cross-validation to select the best-performing model for the dataset.
5. **Prediction**: Train the XGBoost model to predict energy consumption accurately.
6. **Insights and Visualization**: Generate actionable insights and visualize trends in energy usage for better decision-making.

## 🌟 Use Cases:
